Themes Application
==================

This application is used to allow the use of different themes in webpymail.

It has several components:

 * *theme_name* context processor will create a template variable named 'theme'.

 * Reimplemented *render_to_response*, this will try to get the template from the following list:
    1. `<theme name>/<template name>`
    2. `<default theme>/<template name>`
    3. `<template name>`
 *render_to_response* should be used in the same way as before.
 * Made a few modifications to the django's default tags: extends and include in order for them to use the same template searching. To use this tags it's necessary load them with:

{{{
 {% load loader_tags %}
}}}

The current theme can be defined in several ways:

 * Define DEFAULT_THEME in settings.py (Default: "default")
 * Use the configuration files, section 'general', option 'theme'
 * Pass the new theme in a GET request: ?theme=foo

The choose theme is stored on the django's session.
