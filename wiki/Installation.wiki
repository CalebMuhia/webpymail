= Warning =

Webpymail is still on its early development stages, it's not yet
feature complete and could possibly cause damage to you data.

= Dependencies =

To test webpymail you need:

  # Django svn
  # Python 2.5

= Installation steps =

  * Get python and django working;
  * Choose a suitable folder and checkout webpymail source code:

{{{
svn checkout http://webpymail.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ webpymail-source
}}}

  * Add the webpymail-source dir to your PYTHONPATH

{{{
cd webpymail-source
export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`:$PYTHONPATH
}}}

  * Create or edit the webpymail/local_settings.py file according to your needs, the most important setting to add is:

{{{
SMTPHOST = 'your smtp server'
}}}

The local_settings.py is imported from the main settings file. This way you don't have to reconfigure each time you update you svn working copy.

Please note that, for the moment, no auth is supported on the smtp server.

  * Edit the file servers.conf in webpymail/config/servers.conf and add your server. Please note that right now the Google IMAP is not working (they don't support server side threading and sorting and we still don't do that on the client side). A server entry must be something like:

{{{
[macavity]

name = Macavity
host = paxjulia.com
port = 993
ssl  = true
}}}

  * Create the temporary directory to store the attachments while composing a message, by default:

{{{
mkdir /tmp/webpymail
}}}

  * Go to the webpymail dir and create the data base:

{{{
$ cd webpymail
$ python manage.py syncdb
[... snip ...]
Creating table mailapp_userprofile

You just installed Django's auth system, which means you don't have
any superusers defined.
Would you like to create one now? (yes/no): yes
Username (Leave blank to use 'helder'):
E-mail address: helder@paxjulia.com
Password:
Password (again):
Superuser created successfully.
[... snip ...]
}}}

You must create a superuser.

  * Start the Django included web server:

{{{
$ python manage.py runserver
}}}

  * Finally you can access the webmail app, just go to: http://127.0.0.1:8000/ . Login with a valid user on the IMAP server.
